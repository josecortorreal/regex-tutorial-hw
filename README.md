Welcome to the Regex Tutorial: Exploring Regular Expressions! In this tutorial, we will dive deep into the world of regular expressions (regex) and learn how to construct powerful search patterns for text matching. Regular expressions are a sequence of characters that define a search pattern, helping you find, match, and manipulate text efficiently. They are widely used in programming, data processing, and text editing tasks.

In this tutorial, we will focus on various regex components and their usage. Each section will provide clear explanations, examples, and code snippets to illustrate how they work. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of regex components and be able to apply them to your projects effectively.
